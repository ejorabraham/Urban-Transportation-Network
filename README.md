# MobilityChain: Decentralized Urban Transportation Network

A blockchain-powered platform that optimizes urban mobility through real-time traffic management, intelligent public transportation routing, and coordinated shared mobility services.

## Overview

MobilityChain creates an integrated urban mobility ecosystem that connects traffic infrastructure, public transportation, private vehicles, and pedestrians. The platform uses smart contracts and IoT devices to optimize traffic flow, incentivize sustainable transportation choices, and improve urban mobility efficiency.

## Core Features

### Traffic Management
- Real-time traffic flow monitoring
- Dynamic signal timing optimization
- Congestion prediction
- Incident detection and response
- Emergency vehicle prioritization

### Public Transportation
- Real-time fleet management
- Dynamic route optimization
- Demand-responsive scheduling
- Passenger load balancing
- Service disruption management

### Shared Mobility
- Ride-sharing coordination
- Micro-mobility management
- Dynamic pricing
- Vehicle availability tracking
- Last-mile connectivity

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- `TrafficFlow.sol`: Manages traffic data and signal timing
- `TransitOps.sol`: Handles public transportation operations
- `RideShare.sol`: Coordinates shared mobility services
- `IncentiveSystem.sol`: Manages mobility rewards
- `MobilityNFT.sol`: Issues achievement tokens

### IoT Infrastructure

- Signal controllers
- Vehicle trackers
- Passenger counters
- Environmental monitors

### Backend Services
- Node.js/Express API
- TimescaleDB for time-series data
- MongoDB for user data
- Redis for real-time coordination
- Apache Kafka for event streaming

### Frontend Applications
- Traffic control dashboard
- Transit operator interface
- Passenger mobile app
- Driver application
- Analytics platform
